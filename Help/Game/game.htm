          is a classical arcade style action game. You are in control of a
          fighter that can move across the screen and fire various weapons,
          while enemies continue to stream in from the upper screen border. But
          Zooom features modern technology: A DirectX enhanced engine,
          all-rendered graphics and lots of features guarantee for an up to date
          gaming experience, while bringing back&nbsp; the unique feeling of
          action games that are rarely released in this time of rts, threedee
          and roleplaying. In addition, Zooom is highly customizable: Players
          can create their own levels using the built-in scripting language, and
          advanced users can even create plugins containing whole new sets of
          enemy graphics and behavior.<br>
          <br>
          This page gives you a brief overview on how to play Zooom: How does
          the interface work, what weapons, powerups, fighters and enemies can
          you expect, and how can the game be configured. Creation of custom
          levels and plugins is treated in another section.</font></p>

          is played with two goals in mind: To complete the campaign you are
          playing, and to achieve a score as high as possible by shooting as
          many enemy ships as you can. Select a campaign to play in the CAMPAIGN
          menu. Then select START GAME to play the selected campaign. During
          each campaign, when reaching certain score standings an extra fighter
          will be awarded to you. This UP scores vary from campaign to campaign.<br>
          <br>
          Within a campaign, there are several levels to be completed. Fight
          your way through a level and finish it to advance to the next level.
          If you loose a fighter during a level, you will be reset to the
          beginning of this level (NOT to the beginning of the campaign). You
          will loose all upgrades you have collected so far, though.<br>
          <br>
          If you loose the last fighter in your fleet, the game is over and if
          you have broken the highscore for the campaign you've been playing,
          your score will be entered in the highscore table. Completing the
          campaign makes for an entry in the highscore table, too.<br>
          <br>
          If you find yourself unable to complete a certain campagin, or always
          get stuck at the same point in a level, try reducing game difficulty.
          This can be done in the SETTINGS menu. Higher difficulty levels will
          make your fighter's weaponry weaker and that of the enemies stronger,
          as well as increasing enemy shoot frequency and aiming accuracy.&nbsp;</font><font color="#8080C0" size="1" face="Arial"><br>

          it's possible to cheat. Yes, it takes the whole fun out of Zooom. Yes,
          you should only use cheating if you have to test a custom level or

          level. No, if you are cheating, this fact will not be broadcastet,
          along with your name, to the Zooom website and posted there for
          everyone to see ... that's definitely a rumor ;-).<br>
          To Cheat, hold down CTRL key and press 1 for the next fighter weapon,
          2 for the next mount level, 3 for the next drone level, 4 to completely repair your
          fighter, 5 for shields and 6 to add a fighter to your fleet.<br>

          destroy your ship (is this cheating?), 8 will instantly complete the
